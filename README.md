# ECODATA-Animate

ECODATA-Animate is a MATLAB® program for creating customized animated maps of animal movements. The program creates image frames that can be animated using the [ECODATA-Prepare Movie Maker App](https://ecodata-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/movie_maker.html). Define track visualization options and include additional layers from raster files, shapefiles, an elevation model and label lists. See [ECODATA-Prepare](https://ecodata-apps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for additional tools for preparing input data. Development is supported by MathWorks® and the NASA Earth Science Division, Ecological Forecasting Program, as part of the [Room to Roam: Y2Y Wildlife Movements](https://ceg.osu.edu/Y2Y_Room2Roam) project.
